PUN INTENTED>>> LIVE bait shop >> we are also going to make our website live... no points for being punny?

Visit the website: https://www.howardslakesidegeneralstore.com/

I think it needs your help!

CHALLENGE YOURSELF!  We have learned many things this semester. You have the skills now to make this page look waay better.

They have hired you! They are paying you $2500 to help them get updated. (well they don't know that yet... but we will keep that our little motivating secret for now)

Create a minimum of two pages to help them redesign this site. I want you to create those two pages as if you were to present your creation to the client themselves. I doubt they will be impressed (me either) if you put in a bunch of lorem ipsum gibberish. Make it real.

What have you learned? Should it be RESPONSIVE? YES... how will you make it responsive? Flex Boxes, Media queries, Grids? That is up to you.

You have mad skills now. Show it here.

If you need inspiration on what content you could add, or what a bait store might look like, GOOGLE! Go to the wise ole google owl and find other bait stores. What ideas can you implement on this site? Is this copying? Sure if you copy and paste their code. But no, if you use it to ignite your own inspiration.

You will be graded based on the amount of professionalism that is put into the site. If the page looks similar to what it does now, not many points. If the page demonstrates responsiveness, floats, professional CSS styling - many points
